 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch and Other Projects

- `logistic_regression`: Module containing my implementation of logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It includes functions for calculating the objective function, gradient, and performing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent.
